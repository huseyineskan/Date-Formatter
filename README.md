Date Formatter

## Description
Working with dates in JavaScript can be difficult. You need to navigate a variety of methods, formats, and time zones. In this project, we learned how to work with the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. We also learned how to format dates correctly.

This project will cover concepts such as `getDate()`, `getMonth()` and `getFullYear()` methods.
